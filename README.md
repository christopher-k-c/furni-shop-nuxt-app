# Convertoo Frontend Coding Test

> Congratulations on making it to the coding test section of the interview process, in this test, you will be building a simple landing page with a registration form using NuxtJS and TailwindCSS.

## Project Setup

Before you begin, you should make sure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

* Node.js
* NPM
* NuxtJS
* TailwindCSS

To set up the project, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Run npm install to install the project dependencies.
* Run npm run dev to start the NuxtJS development server.
* You should now be able to access the application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Landing Page

The landing page should be visually appealing and use the TailwindCSS utility classes to create a responsive layout. The page should include the following elements:

* A header with a logo and navigation links.
* A hero section with a heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button.
* A features section with three feature blocks that highlight the benefits of the product or service.
* A pricing section with three pricing plans and a call-to-action button for each plan.
* A footer with contact information and social media links.

## Registration Form

The registration form should be simple and include the following fields:

* First Name
* Last name
* Email
* Phone Number

The form should include client-side validation to ensure that the user has entered a valid email address and that the password and confirm password fields match.

When the user submits the form, the data should be sent to a backend API endpoint for processing. You do not need to implement the backend API endpoint for this coding test, but you should include a console.log statement to indicate that the form submission was successful.

## Additional Requirements

In addition to the basic landing page and registration form functionality, there are a few additional requirements for this project:

* The landing page should be fully responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.
* The form should include error messages to indicate when the user has entered invalid data.
* The form should include a loading state to indicate when the form is being submitted.

## Conclusion

That's it! You now have all the information you need to complete the NuxtJS TailwindCSS Landing Page and Registration Form coding test. Good luck!
